                                C++ is a practical tool. It’s not perfect, but it’s useful.
                                
                                In the world of industrial software, C++ is viewed as a solid, mature, mainstream tool. It has widespread industry support which makes it “good” from an overall business perspective.</p>

                                Nope.

C++ wasn’t designed to demonstrate what a perfect language looks like. It was designed to be a practical tool for solving real world problems. It has a few warts, as do all practical programming tools, but the only place where it’s appropriate to keep fiddling with something until it’s perfect is in a pure academic setting. That wasn’t C++’s goal.

                            <p>Lots and lots of companies and government sites. Lots. And if you’re using a compiler or runtime of another language, such as Java, chances are good that it too is implemented in C++.

                                There are too many C++ users to effectively count them, but the number is in the millions. C++ is supported by all major vendors. The large number of developers (and therefore the large amount of available support infrastructure including vendors, tools, training, etc.) is one of several critical features of C++.
                                
                                During 1980-1991, the number of users doubled every seven and a half months (see The Design and Evolution of C++). The current growth rate is steady and positive. IDC’s 2001 estimate of the number of C++ programmers was “about 3 million”; their 2004 number was “more than 3 million.” That seems plausible and indicates a continued growth. Especially since about 2010 there is a renewed growth in C++ as both mobile and datacenter applications value “performance per Watt” as a new mainstream metric.</p>

                            <p>Yes, but don’t expect miracles. Some people seem to believe that a programming language can or at least should solve most of their problems with system building. They are condemned to search forever for the perfect programming language and become repeatedly disappointed. Others dismiss programming languages as unimportant “implementation details” and put their money into development processes and design methods. They are condemned to program in COBOL, C, and proprietary design languages forever. A good language – such as C++ – can do a lot for a designer and a programmer, as long as its strengths and limitations are clearly understood and respected.</p>

                        </div>
                        <div class="accordion__answer">
                            <p>When Stroustrup invented C++, he wanted C++ to be compatible with a complete language with sufficient performance and flexibility for even the most demanding systems programming. He “had a perfect dread of producing yet-another pretty language with unintentional limitations.” See Section 2.7 of The Design and Evolution of C++ for historical details.

                                At the time, Stroustrup considered C the best systems programming language available. That was not as obvious then (1979) as it later became, but Stroustrup had experts such as Dennis Ritchie, Steve Johnson, Sandy Fraser, Greg Chesson, Doug McIlroy, and Brian Kernighan down the corridor from whom he could learn and get feedback. Without their help and advice, and without C, C++ would have been stillborn.
                                
                                Contrary to repeated rumors, Stroustrup was never told that he had to use C; nor was he ever told not to use C. In fact, the first C++ manual grew from troff source of the C manual contributed by Dennis Ritchie. Many new languages were designed at Bell labs; in “Research” at least, there were no rules enforcing language bigotry. </p>

                        </div>
                        <div class="accordion__answer">
                            <p>Stroustrup wanted to write efficient systems programs in the styles encouraged by Simula67. To do that, he added facilities for better type checking, data abstraction, and object-oriented programming to C. The more general aim was to design a language in which developers could write programs that were both efficient and elegant. Many languages force you to choose between those two alternatives.

                                The specific tasks that caused Stroustrup to start designing and implementing C++ (initially called “C with Classes”) had to do with distributing operating system facilities across a network.
